spd-viz
=======

Visualize mobile internet performance via a geographic heatmap. See the visualization running at http://mpm.cs.usc.edu

This project currently uses data from Google's speedometer project https://storage.cloud.google.com/speedometer

The data is heavily preprocessed before it can be visualized - preprocessing code is not part of this repository.. Details will be updated soon.

Credits:
